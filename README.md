# Malignancy Detection in Lung Nodules Using CNN

## Overview
Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early detection of malignant lung nodules can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project presents an automated system utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to assist radiologists in accurately identifying suspicious lung nodules from CT scans.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using:
''bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
''

### Running the Notebook
1. Clone the repository:
  ''bash
   git clone https://github.com/KrishYadav454/Malignancy-Detection-in-Lung-Nodules-Using-CNN.git
   ''
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ''bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ''
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   '' bash
   jupyter notebook
   ''
4. Run the cells sequentially to execute the project.

## Project Structure
